# Default project ideas

This is but a limited selection of project ideas you can chose from. They all have a question or topic, a dataset or an idea on how to get one, and an idea of the methods to be used. Further refining them into a plan is part of your project too. You are encouraged to propose your own project.

## Media and politics

### Social media politics

How election campaigns unfold on social media? Pick one or more campaign and track how different candidates engage with certain topics during the campaign. Datasets: news, Twitter.

### How are Bible (or Quran etc.) quotes used on Twitter?

A simple but important question, given the role of religion in society. Inspiration: [America's Public Bible](http://americaspublicbible.org/). Dataset: news, Twitter.

### Media polarity

Media are often supporting an agenda on their own. Can this agenda be discovered by analysing how differently they report the same news? Build a polarity profile for different media, considering a choice of the variety of datasets available.

### Globalization of the news

The world is becoming increasingly connected. Does the trend toward globalization also exist in the news? If so, since when? Detect and describe the ratio between international and local events through the years in a dataset of news.

## Science of science

### The languages of science

How different is the language of scientists from everyday language? Collect a dataset of abstracts from different scientific disciplines and learn a language model for each of them. Assess their distance from a baseline model learned from news or Wikipedia. Dataset: arXiv, PubMed OA, JSTOR, ask me.

### Science and hype

Are scientists hyping their results? Find a way to measure hype, and check if it is increasing over time. Dataset: arXiv, PubMed OA, JSTOR, ask me.

### Mapping machine learning research

Detect trends in machine learning research over the past years/decades. Dataset: arXiv.

### Recommending research

Build a recommender system for scientific publications based on their contents and a user query. Dataset: arXiv, PubMed OA, JSTOR.

## Language of

Perform an analysis of the language of the following categories of documents, using language models, sentiment analysis, clustering and any other technique you like. Try to come up with a question you would like answered.

### Films

### Songs
